The orchestrator will coordinate tasks, manage the context provided to agents,
and route work. Provider-specific behavior, request formats, and response
handling must remain isolated behind agent/provider adapters. Adding or changing
a provider should not require rewriting orchestration logic.

Proposed supporting modules cover tasks, project memory, project-specific
knowledge, reviews, tools, and shared utilities. Changes should be reviewed and
validated before controlled application to a project. Git will keep the
authoritative project history and make significant changes traceable.

## Orchestrator v0.1

The initial orchestration core uses provider-neutral task and result models, an
agent interface, an in-memory registry, and a local mock agent. Dispatch is
explicit: the caller supplies `agent_name`; the orchestrator does not choose an
agent or automatically route between providers.

  -> Registry

This version does not connect to real AI providers. Provider integrations and
automatic routing remain future work.
