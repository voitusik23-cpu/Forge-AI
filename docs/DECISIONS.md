# Architectural decisions

- Project name: Forge AI.
- Forge AI is intended to be a reusable AI development and orchestration
  platform.
- The architecture must be modular.
- AI providers must be isolated behind adapters.
- The orchestrator coordinates agents rather than containing
  provider-specific logic.
- Secrets must never be stored in Git.
- Git is the source of truth for project history.
- Significant changes must be traceable.
- Agents should receive only the context required for their task whenever
  possible.
- The system must actively optimize token and context usage.
- Agents should not repeatedly scan the entire project unnecessarily.
- Autonomous production changes must be controlled.
- New functionality should be developed in small, understandable modules.
- Tests should accompany important functionality.
